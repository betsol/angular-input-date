# angular-input-date 1.0.5

This module provides a very simple directive to enable support for `input[type="date"]` with the latest stable version of AngularJS (`~1.2.26`).

With this, you can implement a simple HTML5 standard datepicker for AngularJS.

Look at the [Demo][demo].

*The latest stable version of AngularJS (`~1.2.26`) has no support for `input[type="date"]`.
The support was added only for `1.3` branch of Angular, which is now in beta.*

## Installation

### Install library with bower

`bower install --save angular-input-date`

### Add library to your page

``` html
<script type="text/javascript" src="angular-input-date/src/angular-input-date.js"></script>
```

### Add dependency in your application's module definition

``` javascript
var application = angular.module('application', [
    // ...
    'ngInputDate'
]);
```

## Usage

Just include the following HTML snippet to your page:

``` html
<input type="date" ng-model="myDateObject">
```

You can specify scope value in your controller like this:

``` javascript
application.controller('AppCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.myDateObject = new Date(2014, 3, 19);
});
```

Your date variable must be a proper [`Date`][mdn-date] object.
Read section *Detecting value changes* for more details on `Date` object requirements.

Here's the [Demo Example][demo] of how you can use this.

## Notes

### Detecting value changes

There are situations when you want to compare initial (master) value of the input
with the value provided by the user. In order for this to work correctly, you have
to provide initial `Date` object without a time part. We will call such dates *timeless*.

The thing is, that `input[type="date"]` HTML element is not designed to contain time information,
only a date. So when we pass your `Date` object to it, we have to truncate the time part.
And when a value is read from the input, the time part is already gone, so when you will try
to compare it against initial `Date` object, you will get a negative result.

You can create a timeless `Date` object the following way from scratch:
``` javascript
var year = 2014, month = 5, day = 25;
var dateWithoutTime = new Date(year, (month - 1), day);
```

Or if you want to convert existing `Date` object to timeless one, we provide a special
function to do so. Consider the following example:

``` javascript
application.controller('AppCtrl', function($scope, someExistingDate, inputDate) {
    $scope.entity = {
        date: inputDate.ExtractDate(someExistingDate)
    };
});
```

You have to inject our service called `inputDate` and invoke it's `ExtractDate` method.
It will return proper timeless `Date` object.

## Ranges validation

``` html
<input type="date" date-options min-limit="startDate" max-limit="endDate"  ng-model="myDateObject">
```

You can specify scope value in your controller like this:

``` javascript
application.controller('AppCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.myDateObject = new Date(2014, 3, 19);
    $scope.startDate = new Date(2014, 3, 16);
    $scope.endDate = new Date(2014, 3, 23);
});
```
